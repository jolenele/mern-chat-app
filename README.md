# Project Report:

1. What I have done/used:

- Mongoose using MongoDB Cloud Atlas - Connect database successfully, be able to read, write, update and delete
- Socket IO - configure both side client and server
- Backend Server - Node.js
- React
- Redux
- Authentication with JWT Token - Create new account and login

2. What I have not finished:

- Display the Chat Box
- Retrieve and set messages from server to client side
- Display event logs
- Display chat history
- Change room feature on client side

3. What I have problems with or need to improve on:

- React and Redux - I spent most of the time learning and debugging React and Redux
- Establish the socket connection from client to server though React and Redux (resovled)
- The wavering in using functional vs class React component
